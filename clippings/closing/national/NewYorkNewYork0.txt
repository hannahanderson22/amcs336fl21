THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE EXPOSITION.

The first stake for the location of the fair buildings In St. Louis was driven September 3, 1901.

The site chosen Included 1,240 acres in Forest Park and adjacent lands, six miles from the Mississippi River.

Ground was broken for the construction of the buildings by David R. Francis, president of the World's Fair Commission, on December 20, 1901.

The date of opening, originally set for April 30, 1903, was deferred by act of Congress for a year. On April 30 and May 1 and 2, 1903, formal dedicatory exercises wore held, at which President Roosevelt and ex-President Cleveland spoke.

On April 30, 1904, the exposition was formally opened for a period of seven months, the President starting the machinery by wire from the White House and 187,793 persons visiting the grounds.

The exposition commemorated the centennial of the purchase from France of the Louisiana Territory, from which fourteen States and Territories have been formed beyond the Mississippi River.

The score of large buildings contained 128 acres of exhibit floor space, far exceeding that of any other world's fair. The government and nearly all the States and Territories had special buildings, while threescore foreign countries and colonies were represented in exhibits.

The entire cost is estimated at about $30,000,000, of which the expenditures before the opening amounted to $20,000,000, including $5,000,000 to appropriated by the government, a like sum by St. Louis and $5,000,000 raised by private subscriptions, and a government loan of $4,600,000 repaid from the gate receipts.

The rest of the expenditures included cost of operation, the amounts paid out by State and foreign governments and the expenses of exhibitors. The total attendance was about 18,750,000, of which 14,000,000 were paid admissions, the total receipt's from which were $6,000,000. Large sums were received for the concessions on "The Pike."

A special feature was the Philippine exhibit, which it cost the government and the exposition company nearly $1,000,000 to install and which attracted many visitors. The International Press Parliament, held in May and the Peace Congress, under the auspices of the Interparliamentary Union, in September, were conspicuous assemblages.

Nearly all the days of the period the exposition lasted were devoted to especial purposes. A week in August was set apart for the State of Missouri. The largest single days attendance was on St. Louis Day. September l5.

New-York Day was observed on October 4, when Governor Odell and other State officials took part In the exercises in the fine New-York State Building, which cost $350,000.

President Roosevelt paid a visit to the fair on November 26, and with his party spent a day in a hurried survey of the most attractive features, at the end of which he said: "I have had the best time I have ever had in my life."
