The great Louisiana Purchase Fair closed Thursday night, Dec. 1st, at Midnight. President Francis, in an address at the Louisiana monument, touched a button which turned the lights out, leaving the beautiful buildings in darkness, and turning what had been a fairy scene during the summer and fall, into a gloomy spectacle. President Francis and Treasurer Thompson of the Exposition Company were presented with silver table sets which cost respectively $17,000 and $15,000. The Pike was a scene of hilarity never witnessed before. Over its entire length a crowd, estimated at one hundred thousand persons, streamed, and with all sorts of noises, musical and otherwise, worked out their own sweet wills until midnight. It was estimated that more than two hundred thousand persons visited the fair on the last day.
