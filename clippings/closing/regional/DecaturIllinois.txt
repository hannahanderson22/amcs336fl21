LAST NIGHT ON THE ST. LOUIS PIKE

A great crowd gathers and holds high carnival until midnight.

St. Louis, Dec. 2. - It was a rollicking, merry-making crowd that brought the Louisiana Purchase exposition to a close last night on the Pike.

It was with longing looks and sorrowful expressions that the 100,000 pleasure-seeking Pikers turned their backs on the scenes of mirth and joyousness which have been a feature of the World's Fair.

Never in the history of St. Louis festivals and bazaars has the police encountered such a frolicsome crowd. Their happy expressions and pranks turned the serious expressions of the great army of officers into a sunny disposition.

AN ARMY OF POLICE.

Expecting disturbance the exposition officials had drawn together the largest band of special and uniformed officers ever assembled for one function St. Louis.

Up and down the Pike, in every corner and in front of every concession, stood the uniformed guardians of the law. Intersected and carefully scrutinizing every move of the vast assemblage, who roamed at will in every direction, silently strolled the plain-clothes specials from Chief Desmond's office, and mingling with the crowd and Joining in the merriment with the Jefferson Guards.

Days of the celebration of the Mardi Gras and the Veiled Prophet were eclipsed in the excitement of the closing hours of the Pike. Few realized that it was their last opportunity of the enjoyment of the Pike, but all were imbued with the holiday spirit.
