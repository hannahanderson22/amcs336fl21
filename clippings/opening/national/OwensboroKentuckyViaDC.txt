Wheels of Exposition Set in Motion From Washington.

Washington, D.C., April 30 - In compliance with the request of the directors of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, the president opened the exposition by wire from the White House shortly after 1 o'clock today. The arrangements were simple in detail. Immediately upon the completion of the wire circuit into the exposition grounds the president was notified and he repaired to the East Room, where there were assembled the justices of the United States supreme court, the members of the diplomatic crops, and a number of other guests of note. The arrangements contemplated a prompt opening of the exposition at noon central time, but there were a few minutes delay in making the final preparations. President Roosevelt stood at the key chatting with those about him. In the course of the conversation he expressed regrets at his inability to be present at the opening of the exposition in person, but said that he hoped he might be able to visit the great fair later in the year. A few minutes after 1 o'clock a message from President Francis saying that all was ready and requesting that the machinery of the exposition be started was ticked off the wires and handed to President Roosevelt. Mr. Roosevelt then gently pressed on the Morse key, which action instantly gave the signal to the St. Louis end and put in motion the whole of the exposition. A few minutes later a message of congratulation was sent by the President and a reply that the program was carried out successfully and everyone was in a wild hurrah over the opening.
